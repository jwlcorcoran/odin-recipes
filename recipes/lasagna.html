        <p>My husband really loved this. There is a lot of liquid, and when I saw how much of the sauce there was I knew there was no way this was fitting in an 8 in. baking dish. I made it in a deep 9x13 pan and it barely fit. I did modify a bit: used ricotta cheese instead of cottage so it was less watery; added 1 chopped jalapeño to the sauce for a little more flavor and a bit of spice; did not have tomatoes with cilantro and lime so juiced 1/2 lime and chopped some cilantro into the sauce; and definitely need more than 5 tortillas, especially since it needs to go into a bigger dish. It has very good flavor, but the tortillas actually kind of disintegrate so you don't really have layers at the end.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped </li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped </li>
            <li>1 ¼ pounds ground turkey </li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro </li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package small-curd cottage cheese </li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin </li>
            <li>5 (6 inch) corn tortillas, halved </li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend </li>
            <li>cooking spray </li>
            <li>1 green onion, diced </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in ground turkey; cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Stir enchilada sauce and diced tomatoes into the pot. Simmer until flavors combine, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, egg, and cumin together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the turkey sauce in the bottom of an 8-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the corn tortillas. Spread 1/2 of the cottage cheese mixture on top. Sprinkle 1/3 of the Mexican cheese on top. Repeat layers once more, ending with remaining turkey sauce and Mexican cheese.</li>

        </ol>
